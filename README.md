🌍 COSMOTRAVEL — AI City Travel Planner

CosmoTravel is an AI-powered travel discovery app that helps people decide where to travel inside a city on a budget.
It creates smart itineraries, finds local dishes, suggests places to explore, and gives real-time smart search — all wrapped inside a beautiful UI.

This project uses React + TailwindCSS on the frontend, Node.js / Express on the backend, AI Agents for itinerary generation, and Supabase Authentication for secure user login.
